# Contribute to the Docs

---

To contribute to the Druid documentation, simply interact with [our Git repository](https://github.com/highcard-dev/docs).  
While knowledge of Git is helpful, it is not required.

If you are familiar with Git, the following guide is probably too detailed.

Also see the [Helpful links for editing the documentation](#helpful-links-for-editing-the-documentation) to learn more about the tools we use to run our documentation.

It is also very helpful if you want to improve your technical skills, as tools like Git, GitHub, Markdown, etc. are widely used.

## Editing an existing Page

---

### 1. Select the Page

Select the page you want to edit and click on the edit link at the bottom of the page.

### 2. Sign in to GitHub

Log in to your GitHub account or [create a new account on github.com](https://github.com/signup) if you do not already have one.

### 3. Fork the Repository

Create a fork of the Druid documentation repository in your account.

### 4. Edit

Now you can directly edit the page. Each page is written in Markdown.

Markdown is a simple way to format a document and include images, text, links, etc.

Here you can read more about Markdown: [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)  
If you prefer a quick reference, here is a cheatsheet: [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

### 6. Create Pull Request

Create a pull request to propose your changes.

A pull request is a suggestion to add your changes to the Druid documents.

It remains open until we have reviewed your changes and either merge them or request changes.

## Create a Documentation Page

---

There are several ways to add a new file.

If you are familiar with Git, you can clone the repository and make changes locally.

If you are a beginner, simply follow this guide.  
For more information, see the [additional links below](#helpful-links-for-editing-the-documentation) to learn more about the tools we use in our documentation.

### 1. Fork the Docs Repository

First create a fork of the documentation repository.

![fork](/img/contribute/add/1-fork.png)
![fork submit](/img/contribute/add/2-fork-submit.png)

### 2. Add File

Now you can see the entire repository and navigate the folder structure.

Simply navigate to the `/docs/` folder, and you should find some `md` files and other folders. These represent the structure you can see in the documentation. Just go to the appropriate folder and select `Add file`.

In this folder, you can only contribute to the English documentation!

For other languages, please navigate to the `/i18n/` folder and then to the folder of the respective language.

Now make the changes. See [Step 4 of the previous guide](#4-edit) for more details.

Alternatively you can upload a markdown file, just make sure it ends with
`.md`.
