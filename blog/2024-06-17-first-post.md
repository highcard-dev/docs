# Druid Blog Update 1

Thanks for visiting my first blog post on the Druid blog.
I am writing this post, because there are multiple reasons wich are coming together, wich usually is a good call to actions.

## Druid Blog
First of all we recently have setup this blog to share thoughts and updates about Druid in lengthier and mor persistent way, as we could in our Discord Server (wich you definitely should join).
There are also some more practical reason to grow our business. I think it's no secret in the SEO community, that this makes sense. There is of cause the danger in this day and age to spam out blogposts using AI, without producing a lot of value.
This is not want we want to do here.
We hope to share stories or do general blogposts about interesting things related to Druid and not just running a soulless content mill.
Let's see if we are able to create processes around this blog, to make it great!
